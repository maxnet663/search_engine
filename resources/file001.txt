Anton Pavlovich Chekhov (1860-1904), Russian
writer, prose writer and playwright,
who lived and worked at the turn of two centuries,
absorbed the best examples of classical
Russian literature and supplemented them with true
understanding of the human soul. Exactly this
circumstance allowed him to leave
a huge legacy, including plays,
stories and novels.

Chekhov Anton Pavlovich began his
literary activity as an author
feuilletons and short humorous
stories (pseudonym - Antosha Chekhonte and
etc.). The main themes of creativity are ideological
quest of the intelligentsia, discontent
philistine existence alone,
spiritual "humility" before vulgarity
the lives of others ("A Boring Story", 1889;
"Duel", 1891; "House with a mezzanine", 1896; "Ionych",
1898; "Lady with a dog", 1899). In stories
"Indian Kingdom" (1894), "Guys" (1897), "In
ravine "(1900), the writer showed wildness and
the cruelty of village life. Great strength
social and artistic generalization
Chekhov achieved in the stories "Ward No. 6" (1892),
"The Man in the Case" (1898). In the plays "The Seagull"
(1896), "Uncle Vanya" (1897), "Three Sisters" (1901),
The Cherry Orchard (1904) staged
Moscow Art Theatre,
created a special, disturbing emotional
atmosphere of anticipation of the future. Main
Chekhov's hero is an ordinary man with his
daily chores and worries.

In numerous Chekhov stories
turns to the study of the soul
modern man experiencing
influence of various social, scientific
and philosophical ideas: pessimism ("Lights", 1888),
social Darwinism ("Duel", 1891),
radical populism ("Story
unknown person", 1893); decides
issues of concern to society
relations ("Three years", "Spouse",
"Ariadne", all 1895), anomalous phenomena
psyche ("The Black Monk", 1894), etc.

The basis of the plots is not
collision of a person with a rough social
environment, but its internal conflict
spiritual world: Chekhov's heroes are "gloomy",
boring, living "in the twilight" people,
become viable in
strength of one's own inability to
creative realization, inability
overcome mental alienation
